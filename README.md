# fuck yeah

This is clone of [fuckyeahnouns](http://fuckyeahnouns.com), a comical site that
we used to use in the GitHub Campfire until it quit working (I believe Yahoo
Images started making them pay).

Anyway, this code was thrown together in a couple hours and is complete horse
shit. It looks like some four year old stapled together a bunch of asynchronous
synchronous code with a glue gun. Don't like that? Well, I probably had sex
with your mom.
